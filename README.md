# ComputationalPhysics
*A collection of computational solutions to various problems in physics. The solutions include graphical results as well as animated visualizations of the different physical systems.*

## Areas of Exploration
* Numerical solutions of ODEs using Euler and Euler-Richardson algorithms such as:
	* Projectile Motion with air resistance
	* Charged particle motion in electromagnetic fields
	* Simple harmonic motion
	* Thermodynamics e.g. Newton Cooling
	* Nuclear Decay
* Discrete simulations of statistical mechanical problems such as:
	* Diffusive equilibrium in a partitioned box
	* Random walks in 1 and 2 dimensions

*These problems were proposed by Harvey Gould, Jan Tobochnik, and Wolfgang Christian in their textbook [Computer Simulation Methods](http://www.opensourcephysics.org/items/detail.cfm?ID=7375).  The visualizations and user interfaces were built primarily using the [OpenSourcePhysics](http://www.opensourcephysics.org/webdocs/programming.cfm?t=Overview) framework.*
